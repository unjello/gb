Is a yet another build generator for C++ 

## Why?

Convention-over-configuration seem to work well for Ruby and Maven. I wanted to have similar smooth experience with C++, without a need to write (or even worse, copy around) tons of CMake boilerplate code. I've decided to settle on structure similar to [pitchfork](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/pitchfork). Similar enough, that I've decided to adopt it fully, so maybe get out of `Status: DREAM`, and become a reality ðŸ˜Š
